# New Project Development Proposal

- Try to write out MVP
- Think about high level architecture of the Project
- Possibly find other ways instead of using Web Socket?
  Create a class that's in charge of one aspect of chat app, then I can just replace that with Socket.io
- What I used this instead of that?
- Focus on the core aspect of this application.

# How to demo this project?
- Use chat-bot to demo the project


## Chat Application

- This is a chat application developed using MERN stack.
- While the depth of the knowledge is important, I wanted to expand my knowledge as well through this project. However, instead of MEAN stack, I wanted to use MERN stack, so that I can incorporate the project using React.js. What can I say? I just love React and what it has to offer.

### MVP Features
- Live Chatting (X)
- Direct Message ()
- Multi-chatting room ()
- Notifications (X)
- Search Chat History (X)
- Enrich Text Options (X)

### Models
- Think about which models are required for this app

### User authentication
- Also will be trying something new here. Instead of how user authentication was handled in Minimum, I will be trying oauth, allowing users to use their FaceBook or Gmail account to access the application.

### Styling
- As for styling, I will also use Bootstrap to show my ability to use Bootstrap to conveniently make the application responsive to many different screen sizes.

### Last Comments
- I will try to emphasize learning and implementing new stacks over the complex functionality of the application for now. My main emphasis on this project will be to learn to use MERN stack with fluidity like I am with RoR and React.js. Let me know if you have any questions or comments!
